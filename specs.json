When the file is imported, some information about the file displayed such as pages number, pdf version\u2026. If the document is protected the user have to enter the password to the appropriate field and then reload the pdf. \n\uf0d8 Split options: The user can choose between 7 types of splitting: \u2212 Burst: the input file will be split in single pages. \u2212 Split every \u201cn\u201d pages: the input file will be split every \u201cn\u201d pages. \u2212 Split even pages: the input file will be split at every even page. \u2212 Split odd pages: the input file will be split at every odd page. \u2212 Split after these pages: the input file will be split at the given pages \nnumbers. \u2212 Split at this size: the input file will be split in files of the given size roughly). \u2212 Split by bookmark level: the input file will be split at every page linked by the bookmarks of the selected level this can be very useful if you want to split an e-book in chapters). \n\uf0d8 Destination folder: The user selects the destination folder for the output files specific or same as source). Also, he can select whether he wants the output files to be compressed or not, and the pdf version of the generated documents. \n\uf0d8 Output options: Here the user can define a pattern that will generate file names for the output files. The available complex prefixes that can be used are: \u2212  [CURRENTPAGE]: This prefix variable ensures unique output file names and it&apos;s replaced with the current page number. The number of digits of the generated prefix can be specified appending any number of \u201c#\u201d at the prefix name, inside the square brackets e.g. the prefix [CURRENTPAGE###] will generate prefixes like \u2018001\u2019, \u2018002\u2019...). \n\u2212 [TIMESTAMP]: This prefix variable ensures unique output file names and it&apos;s replaced with the current date and time. Time has milliseconds precision and the replaced variable will be something like \u201c20100206_045107232\u201d that is \u201cYYYYMMDD_HHmmssSSS\u201d. \n\u2212 [FILENUMBER] This prefix variable ensures unique output file names and it&apos;s replaced with a file number according to the output order. The number of digits of the generated prefix can be specified appending any number of &apos;#&apos; at the prefix name, inside the square brackets e.g. [FILENUMBER###] will generate prefixes like &apos;001&apos;, &apos;002&apos;...). A starting number can be appended at the prefix name inside the square brackets e.g. [FILENUMBER13] will generate prefixes like &apos;13&apos;, &apos;14&apos;...). Finally, it can be combined a started number and the number of digits e.g. [FILENUMBER###13] will generate prefixes like &apos;013&apos;, &apos;014&apos;...). \n\u2212 [BASENAME]: This prefix variable is replaced with the original name of the input document. It does not ensure unique output file names and it must be used together with other variables. If it is used alone, the system will use the default filename pattern. \n\u2212 [BOOKMARK_NAME]: This prefix variable can be used only when splitting by bookmarks level. It ensures unique output file names unless two or more bookmarks have the same name) and it enables variable substitution. It&apos;s replaced with the bookmark name. Some characters of the bookmark name could be stripped if they are not valid character for a file name. \n \n\u2212 If left blank, the output file names will take the default pattern [CURRENTPAGE] _ [BASENAME]. \n\u2212 It can be written anything before or after of these prefixes. \uf0d8 RUN button: After the user sets all these parameters, he presses the RUN button and the splitting starts. \n3.1.3 Functional Requirements \nREQ-1: The user can split only once document at a time.

View Acquisitions Acquisition records for Drop-Off, Pickup and Decon donations are created in the CRM system. Inventory Management users should be able to view all past and current acquisitions. Receiving Associates use this function to locate an expected acquisition when receiving a donation at the loading dock. Pickup and Decon crews may also use this function to initiate the process of receiving items while in the truck, on their way to the receiving dock.  Drop Off acquisitions are not typically pre-scheduled as Pick Up and Decon acquisitions except for those submitted through the organizational website. As such, when a donor arrives with an unexpected drop off donation, a new acquisition needs to be able to be created in the CRM system first, at either the customer service desk or at the dock, before it can be viewed in the acquisitions screen. \n3.8.1.

Receive Acquisition A donor in possession of a valid acquisition number can proceed to the receiving dock where the items to be donated will be received and processed, and a donation receipt will be generated. Alternatively, a donor may go directly to the receiving dock, in which case a new acquisition is created by the Receiving Associate before items can be received and processed.  The screens used for the acquisition process should simplify and expedite the data entry process, allowing the Receiving Associate to enter only the information needed to generate the donation receipt. Additional attributes needed to complete the item information and effectively add the item to the inventory can be added at a second step, after the receipt has been printed and the donor has been served. The Receiving Associate can print temporary acquisition labels for items that require further processing.  Pick Up and Decon crews may also initiate the receiving process, entering as much detailed information about the donated items as desired, and generating a donation receipt. They cannot, however, add items to the inventory or complete the acquisition process. A Receiving Associate is required to review all the acquisition information before those actions can take place. \n3.9.1. Actors): \n Donor / Primary Contact \n Administrator \n Director \n Manager \n Customer Service Representative \n Receiving Associate \n Pick Up Associate \n Decon Associate \n3.9.2.

  "2009 - peazip": "3. System Features In this chapter, functional requirements of the application and the features it provides are presented. PeaZip is a file and archive manager application for a computer system that allows users to compressdecompress, authenticate and archive them. All PeaZip\u2019s features are explicated in the following units. \n3.1 System Feature 1 \nBrowsing areas and objects of the computer system. \n \n3.1.1 Description and Priority \n\nPeaZip\u2019s users can browse and gain access, in various ways, to every area e.g. storing units, desktop, users documents etc) of the computer system on which PeaZip runs, as well as to included objects (archives and files). \n3.1.2 StimulusResponse Sequences In the initial window of the application which is also going to be mentioned as file manager interface) there is a button writing \u201cFile\u201d on it. By pressing this particular button, opens a submenu with choices that have to do with browsing and access to areas and objects of the computer systems  \n\nMore specifically: By choosing  \u201cFilesystem\u201d,  users can get  access to an object from an object list of objects that is organized according to a functional hierarchy.. By choosing \u201cBookmarks\u201d, users can get access to an object from a list of objects that have been rated by them as favorites. By choosing \u201cRecent archives\u201d, users can get access to an object from a list of objects that have been recently browsed in PeaZip. Finally, through \u201cOpen path\u201d and \u201cOpen archive\u201d, users can get direct access to a path of an object or a file/archive.  Moreover, browsing and access to computer system\u2019s objects is provided by navigation bar of the file manager interface, with navigation buttons back, forward, up) and refresh button.   \nBy this feature, users are allowed to search and gain access to objects they would like to manage. \n3.1.3 Functional Requirements Installation of no other application is required, for PeaZip to manage this function. The only functional requirement is:    REQ-1: Operating system on the computer system. \n\n3.2 System Feature 2 \nVariety of ways of selection of displayed in file manager interface objects.  \n3.2.1 Description and priority Users are allowed to manage the way of selection of the displayed in file manager interface objects(files and archives). \n3.2.2 StimulusResponse Sequences In the initial window of the application(file manager interface), there is a button writing  \u201cEdit\u201d on it. By pressing this particular button, opens a submenu with choices that have to do with altering ways of selection of files displayed currently at file manager interface. \n \nMore specifically: \u201cSelect all\u201d, selects all objects that are currently displayed at file mager interface. \u201cInvert selection\u201d, allows inverted selection of objectsthis means that all non-selected before the beginning of the function objects are selected and all selected before the beginning of the function objects are deselected). \u201cAll objects\u2026\u201d set of commands, allows selection from the objects displayed on file manager interface, according to: extension, attributes, size and date.. Finally, \u201cSort by selection status\u201d, sorts all objects on file manager interface according to whether they are selected or not.  With this feature users are allowed to flexibly alternate the way of selection of currently displayed objects on file manager interface. This feature is particularly useful for object selection for mass management, especially when the number of currently displayed objects on file manager interface is large thus manual selection object-by-object could lead to errors). \n3.2.3 Functional Requirements   Functional requirements of this feature are exactly the same as the ones of System Feature 1. \n3.3 System Feature 3 \nAccessibility to main application interfacesother than file manager interfaceand modification of  view mode for objects in file manager interface.  \n3.3.1 Description and Priority Users are allowed to instantly access other main application interfacesspecifically create archive interface and extraction interface-these features are described in following chapters), as well as changing view mode for  objects(archives and files) displayed in file manager interface. \n3.3.2 StimulusResponse Sequences In the initial window of the application(file manager interface), there is a button writing \u201cBrowser\u201d on it. By pressing this particular button, opens a submenu with choices that have to do with transferring to main interfaces of PeaZip and selecting view mode for objects (archives and files) displayed in file manager interface.   \n\n More specifically: \u201cGo to archiving layout\u201d, leads directly to create archive interface.  \u201cGo to extraction layout\u201d, leads directly to extraction interface. Note: the previous two functions are described in detail in following chapters, whereas the sequence of actions that was described is not the only way of approaching those two interfaces). \u201cToggle browse/flat view\u201d, displays all together the objects contained in the current path or in the archive. Finally, \u201cRefresh\u201d, refreshupdate of currently displayed content  This particular feature allows users to gain direct access to other main interfaces of PeaZip than file manager interface.

More specifically, functions that are features by the tools mentioned above are: - Secure file deletion, intended for securely remove files and folders from disk, avoiding possible data recovery. This is implemented by multiple successive passes of the deletion procedure over the storage area of the selected for deletion file. -Byte to byte file comparison, which spots exactly what the different bytes are and is not susceptible to collisions under any circumstance, even if conditions are highly improbable and very difficult or not practically possible to trigger if a proper hash function is chosen. - Check files, which is useful for finding duplicate files and checking files for corruption when an original checksum or hash value is known. -Split file and merge split volumes back to the original file. -Information display for selected by users) files. Number of files, older and newer object\u2019s datetime, total space occupation, and larger and smaller object\u2019s sizes are presented. - Hexadecimal preview, which allows view of the content of a file represented as hexadecimal values.  Through this set of features, users are allowed to handle files easier and more adequately. \n3.5.3 Functional Requirements Functional requirements of this feature are exactly the same as the ones of System Feature 1. \n \n3.6 System Feature 6 \nArchive extraction.  \n3.6.1 Description and Priority \n \n \nUsers can use PeaZip for decompressing the contents of a selected by them) compressed archive and extract them in a folder. Name and storage space of the folder in the computer system, are up to users to decide. The archive, whose contents are extracted, is neither destroyed, nor deleted and it is not left empty. On the contrary, it retains its content and name and remains saved at the same place of the computer system that was initially stored.   For the procedure of decompression and extraction to be completed, it is necessary that the selected archive is of one of the supported for extraction by PeaZip formats. In case the selected  archive is encrypted, user must know and insert password and if there is one) keyfile in order to have access to the archives contents for browsing or extracting them).  Read-only browsing and extraction) formats supported by PeaZip: 7z, 7z-sfx, ARCWRC, BZ2TBZ2, custom, GZTGZ, PAQLPAQ, PEA, QUADBALZ, split, TAR, UPX, ZIP, ACE, ARJ, CAB, CHM, COMPOUNDMSI, DOC, XLS, PPT), CPIO, ISO, Java(JAR, EAR, WAR), LinuxDEB, PETPUP, RPM, SLP), LHALZH, LZMA, MacDMGHFS), NSIS, Open Office files, PAKPK3PK4, RAR,SMZIP, U3P, UDF, VHD, WIM, XAR, XPI, XZ, ZTZ \n3.6.2 StimulusResponse Sequences DecompressionExtraction function is set off and defined in extraction window which is also going to be referred as extraction interface).

This feature is one of the most important for users, because not only does it offer access to the contents of a compressed, in one of the supported by PeaZip formats, archive, but it allows extraction of those contents in non-compressed format too, in order to be used according to users\u2019 desires. \n3.6.3 Functional Requirements \nFunctional requirements of this feature are exactly the same as the ones of System Feature 1. \n3.7 System Feature 7 \nArchive creation and update.  \n3.7.1 Description and Priority  \n \nUsers are allowed to compress one or more objects (files or archives) in one or more compressed archive volumes sizing less or equally to the original onesin one of the offered for compression by PeaZip formats. Furthermore, users are allowed to update an archive by adding extra objects-files or archives-to an already existing archive), as well as choose objects that are to be included in an archive.  Name and storage space in the computer system) for the created archives are defined by users. In cases of updating adding objects) the name of the compressed file which is updated and its storage space remain the same as they were before the update. The objects that are contained in the created archive are not destroyed, are not deleted and are not left empty. On the contrary, they retain their content and name and remain saved at the same space of the computer system where they were initially stored. Furthermore, encryption (\u201clock\u201d) can be used for the created archives by setting password and optionally) keyfile. Compression to read-only supported formats is not possible.  Fully supported by PeaZip archiving and compression formats: 7z, 7z-sfx, ARCWRC, BZ2TBZ2, custom, GZTGZ, PAQLPAQ, PEA, QUADBALZ, split, TAR, UPX, ZIP \n3.7.2 StimulusResponse Sequences Creating and Updating archives feature is set off and defined in Create archive window which is also going to be referred as Create archive Interface).

This is the icon of the button:  \n                                                                      \n 4 By selecting one or more objects to be added to an archive from file manager interface, clicking the right button of the mouse of the computer system or the equivalent button of the equivalent input device that the computer system may have) and then selecting \u201cAdd\u201d from the submenu. 5 By selecting one or more objects to be added to an archive from some area of the computer system outside of the applications graphical environment), clicking the right button of the mouse of the computer system or the equivalent button of the equivalent input device that the computer system may have) and then selecting \u201cAdd to separate archives\u201d from \u201cSend to\u201d menu.   \n             \n In Create archive windowCreate archive Interface), users are given the ability to select compression format from a list of the supported by PeaZip formats for archiving and compression) for the created archive, choose storage space in the computer system) where the archive is going to be saved and set archive\u2019s name as well as define what should happen in case of existence of a homonym file or archive in the selected storage space). Moreover, selected objects\u2019 data content can be split and be compressed into more than one archive volumes size of each of them is defined by user). Furthermore, timestamp can be appended to the created archive\u2019s name for archiving and backup purpose. Finally, encryption(\u201clocking\u201dof created archives is available, by setting password and optionally) keyfile to them..  Archive creation and update feature is a basic PeaZip feature, as it essentially allows users to save storage space on their computer systems by offering high compression formats, as well as including multiple objects\u2019 content which can be extracted in their initial, non-compressed format) in one single compressed archive. This makes handling and managing multiple objects as a single unit possible. Hence, the double advantage that this feature offers is obvious.   The additional utility of spitting compressed archives in volumes that is offered to users in terms of this feature, allows size adjustment of the created file, while the utility of joining them, brings contended data to their initial state, so that decompression and extraction is possible. In this way, users are able to flexibly manage archives and adapt application\u2019s use to their needs, since a wide range of choices is offered by PeaZip. \n3.7.3 Functional Requirements   \n \nFunctional requirements of this feature are exactly the same as the ones of System Feature 1. \n3.8 System Feature 8 \nSupport of drag and drop between system and application.  \n3.8.1 Description and Priority Users can drag and drop objects (files or archives) between any computer system space and the application. Application\u2019s interfaces that support drag and drop, are file manager interface, create archive interface and extraction interface.  \n3.8.2 StimulusResponse Sequences PeaZip supports drag and drop for object transfer between computer system and the interfaces of the application. Application\u2019s interfaces that support this feature, are file manager interface, create archive interface and extraction interface.   Specifically: \n\u2022 When files and folders are dragged and dropped to the file manager, they get listed in the archive creation interface as if they were selected and added with \u201cAdd\u201d button, as it was described in previous chapters), allowing fine tuning of the function before confirming or canceling it. In the same way, objects that are dragged and dropped to file manager interface while browsing an archive, will be added to the current archive, if the archive format allows modifications e.g. adding objects to an archive format that is supported for reading only will not be possible). \n\u2022 Dragging an archived object (file or archive) from PeaZip to the system, will extract it to the location of the computer system) where it is dropped. If dragged objects are contained in a compressed archive, then they are automatically decompressed before being extracted to the location where they are dropped. If the dragged objects are not contained in a compressed archive, they are just copied to the location where they are dropped. \n This feature allows users to fast and directly set off basic PeaZip\u2019s functions, making PeaZip even handier. \n3.8.3 Functional Requirements Installation of no other application is required, for PeaZip to manage this function. The only functional requirements are:   \nREQ-1: Operating system on the computer system, for dragging and   dropping objects from computer system to the application. REQ-2: MS Windows any version) operating system on the computer system for dragging and dropping objects from the application to the computer system. Other operating systems with which PeaZip is compatible), do not support this function of this feature. \n3.9 System Feature 9 \nTwo factor authentication password and optionally keyfile).  \n3.9.1 Description and Priority PeaZip allows users to encrypt (\u201clock\u201d) archives during creation or updating, by using password which is demanded by PeaZip or other applications of the same use) and should be inserted, in case some user wants to gain access to an encrypted (\u201clocked\u201d) archive in order to manage it (e.g. browse it, update it, extract its content). For higher security reasons, PeaZip offers users the ability to use keyfile for archives encryption, in addition to the password. Finally, PeaZip can generate a random password and create a random keyfile. Obviously, apart from encryption, PeaZip supports decryption (\u201cunlock\u201d) of encrypted files. \n3.9.2 StimulusResponse Sequence In case a user wishes to \u201clock\u201d an archive during creation or update process) by setting password and optionally) keyfile to it, that can be achieved in one of the following ways: -by pressing, during the archive creation process, the icon with the lock on it and set password and optionally) keyfile, according to user\u2019s preference.  -by selecting, the archive  to be updated, that needs to be \u201clocked\u201d from file manager interface, pressing the button writing \u201cTools\u201d on it and selecting \u201cEnter password/keyfile\u201d from the submenu. Password and optionally) keyfile may then be set in the window that appears. -by selecting the archive to be updated,that needs to be \u201clocked\u201d from file manager interface and pressing the icon with the lock on it, which appears on the status-bar bottom right corner). Password and optionally) keyfile may then be set in the window that appears.     \n                                      \n                         \n-in cases that users wish to use password andor keyfile that the application has created, they have to select the archive they wish to \u201clock\u201d from file manager interface, press the button writing \u201cTools\u201d on it and then select \u201cCreate keyfile\u201d on the appearing submenu. The only thing left is setting the suggested password and optionally) keyfile to the created or updated) archive in one of the ways mentioned above.                                \n This feature is really important for the security of the managed archives and their content data. It allows users to set protection over managed archives and ensure in a way, that no unauthorized user will have access to them.  \n3.9.3 Functional Requirements \nFunctional requirements of this feature are exactly the same as the ones of System Feature 1. \n \n3.10 System Feature 10 \nGraphic display of currently executed functions.  \n3.10.1 Description and Priority PeaZip offers graphic display of the progress of any currently executed throughby it function, through its graphic wrapper, named PeaLauncher. In PeaLauncher\u2019s window, information about the progress of any currently executed function as well as information about its overall results after the end of it) is displayed.  \n3.10.2 StimulusResponse Sequences PeaZip allows users to monitor at any time the progress and the status of any of its functions that is being executed, as well as displaying information about the results of those functions on the archive or file for which they were executed, information about the contents of those archives or files and information that have to do with the execution itself like running time).   \n\nInformation about an object file or archive) are displayed on PeaLauncher\u2019s window, in case of selection by users) of the TestCheck feature as described in previous chapters) for this object.

  "2010 - fishing": "2.2 Functional Requirements Specification \n2.2.1 General Requirements \nThe ELSS must capture all data necessary for recording the fishing activities undertaken by a UK fishing vessel. \nThe ELSS must output the data as an XML file for transmission to the UK fisheries administrations\u2019 ERS system. \nThe ELSS data must be validated against the UK XMLXSD before transmission from the fishing vessel. \nThe ELSS data must be transmitted at the required times set out below in Section 2.5.1. \nEach ELSS data transmission will be acknowledged by a return message from the UK fisheries administrations\u2019 ERS system. \n2.3 Data Capture Functions \n2.3.1 Data Operations \nThere are four main Data Operations required to be processed by the ELSS.  These Operation Types are: \n\u2022 Data operation to capture and deliver formatted ELSS data for transmission by a vessel\u2019s communications systems) to the UK fisheries administrations\u2019 ERS system DAT) \n\u2022 Delete operation to capture and deliver a formatted deletion request for transmission by a vessel\u2019s communications systems) to the UK fisheries administrations\u2019 ERS system to delete previously send data DEL) \n\u2022 Correction operation to capture and deliver a formatted correction request for transmission by a vessel\u2019s communications systems) to the UK fisheries administrations\u2019 ERS system to correct previously send data COR) \n\u2022 Receipt of acknowledgment operation to match acknowledgement with original message and provide a recordreport of acknowledged and un-acknowledged transmissions  \n2.3.2 Report Types \nThe ELSS Report Types to be transmitted from a vessel are: \n\u2022 Departure DEP) \n\u2022 Fishing Activity FAR) \n\u2022 Relocation of Catch RLC) \n\u2022 Transhipment TRA) \n\u2022 Entry into Zone COE) \n\u2022 Exit from Zone COX) \n\u2022 Control Point Area GBRCON) \n\u2022 Discard DIS) \n\u2022 Prior Notification of Arrival to Port PNO) \n\u2022 End of Fishing EOF) \n\u2022 Return to Port RTP) \n\u2022 Landing Declaration LAN) \n\n2.3.3 Data Definitions \nThe data definitions for each report type that are required to be transmitted from the ELSS of a UK fishing vessel are to be found in the annex to this specification.  The data definitions and associated lists of valid codes are incorporated in the UK XMLXSD definitions.  These are available to all ELSS suppliers from the UK FMC. The data definitions also provide for the capture of data items required for the submission of ELSS data to meet 3rd country requirements, e.g. Norway\u2019s requirements that include haul by haul reporting. The ELSS may also provide the means for recording additional data but this must not interfere with the data capture and submission functions as set out below. \n2.4 Capture Functions \nThe ELSS must provide data capture screens for the entry of the logbook, transhipment and landing declaration data that is required to be transmitted to the UK fisheries administrations\u2019 ERS system. The ELSS must use English UK) localizations for all UK Electronic Logbook features. All dates and times must be UTC. The Electronic Logbook data may be populated from other, existing, onboard electronic systems, e.g. a GPS for inserting the date, time and location of transmission, or for inserting the same items at the time of capture, onboard weighing systems, existing onboard databases) to avoid duplication of data entry. \n2.4.1 Printing Features \nThe ELSS must provide the ability to print out  the ELSS logbook data including landing declarations) using an onboard printer. Additionally a formatted electronic print file may be generated out of the ELSS.  This print file can be made available to a master\u2019s representative on-shore, e.g. by email over the onboard communications systems).  The ELSS must provide a means so that electronic print files are protected so that they cannot be modified in any way once generated and distributed. The ELSS may provide features to facilitate other print requirements including: \n\u2022 Generation of hard copies of the Electronic Logbook required when fishing in 3rd country or Regional Fisheries waters, e.g. NAFO, Faroese and Norwegian waters. \n\u2022 Generation of a hard copy logsheet or landing declaration to act as a transport or takeover document. \n\u2022 Generation of a hard copy for providing regulatory returns for Cod and Hake effort reporting. \n2.5 Data Transmission \nThe ELSS must provide Electronic Logbook data for transmission to the UK fisheries administrations\u2019 ERS system in accordance with the frequency requirements defined below Section 5.1). The ELSS should at least be able to transmit data via email, either by being included in a packaged solution with an email system or by linking with an existing on-board email service. Data is required to be emailed as  an xml document attached to an email with a standard Subject header  and sent to the email address of the UK fisheries administrations\u2019 ERS system. The subject header must consist of  a character string containing \u2018ERS \u2013 \u2018 prefixed to the contents of the GBRRN attribute of the Electronic Logbook data being transmitted.  The GBRRN attribute is defined in the UK XMLXSD.  The GBRRN attribute is defined uniquely as the vessels\u2019 RSS Number appended to the current date in YYYYMMDD format) and a 6 digit sequence number, e.g. RSSNumber+YYYYMMDD+999999.  An example of the contents of an email subject could be ERS \u2013 A1234520090623000001. The xml document file name should be based upon the GBRRN attribute defined in the UK XMLXSD.  An example of this format could be A1234520090623000001.  The RSS Number will require to be padded with trailing X\u2019s to ensure that it is always 6 characters in length. Each file should have the suffix of .xml, e.g. A1234520090623000001.xml. All xml documents attached to emails to the UK fisheries administrations\u2019 ERS system must be encrypted using PGP.  It is recognised that communications methods, other than email, are available for data transmission. If an alternative is proposed, this should be advised to the Validation Authority and if feasible and practicable the UK Fisheries Administrations will endeavour to extend their  ERS system to accommodate alternative methods. \n\n2.5.1 Frequency of Transmission \nThe ELSS must permit the Master of the vessel to generate formatted data for transmission to the UK fisheries administrations\u2019 ERS system.  There are 2 categories of transmission, those that must be generated automatically by the ELSS and those that can be generated and transmitted under the control of the Master of the vessel.  The data transmission categories are specified below: \n\u2022 Automatically by the ELSS subject to be overridden by the vessel master) \no at least on a daily basis not later than 24:00 even when there is no catch data with the proviso that if the vessel is in port, has no fish on board and has submitted a landing declaration, transmission may be suspended subject to prior notification to the Fisheries Monitoring Centre of the flag Member State.  Transmission must be resumed \nwhen the vessel leaves port \no immediately after the last fishing operation has been completed \no immediately on departing port \no immediately after a transhipment immediately on completion of the Landing declaration \n\u2022 Generation and transmission under the control of the Master of the vessel \no before entering into port \no at the time of inspection at sea \no at the request of the UK fisheries administrations \n2.5.2 Data Corrections \nThe ELSS must provide facilities to capture and deliver for transmission corrections to previously successfully transmitted data. Data corrections must not be transmitted piecemeal; the entire report containing one or more corrected items must be transmitted.  There is no requirement to identify the data items that have been corrected in the generated corrected report. .  .   All corrections must be easily identifiable within the ELSS user interface. The ELSS must only permit correction messages to be generated and sent for reports sent during a current trip up to the submission of the End of Fishing report for that voyage  \n2.5.3 Data Deletions \nThe ELSS must provide facilities to transmit deletions to previously transmitted data. The ELSS must only permit deletion messages to be generated and sent for reports sent during a current trip up to the End of Fishing report for that voyage. All deletions must be easily identifiable within the ELSS user interface. \n2.5.4 Acknowledgement \nThe ELSS must be able to receive acknowledgement RET) messages transmitted from the UK fisheries administrations\u2019 ERS system.  The ELSS must match each acknowledgement message with the appropriate transmitted data operation, deletion or correction report.  The ELSS must be able to confirm that a transmission has been successfully acknowledged or display any error message should the ELSS receive a negative acknowledgement message. \n2.5.5 Test Transmissions \nPrior to registering a product for approval, a test address for all test email transmissions and test logon details to the UK fisheries administrations\u2019 ERS system will be provided on request.  All requests should be made by contacting the Validation Authority by email in the first instance. The email address is ERS-Logbook-Approvals@NCCGroup.com. Once operational the UK XMLXSD allows for a test message to be sent to the UK fisheries administrations\u2019 ERS system.  This test facility must be used to send test transmissions to establish that the communications between the vessel and the UK fisheries administrations\u2019 ERS system are fully operational.  The UK fisheries administrations\u2019 ERS system will acknowledge any test messages but will not store any data that has been transmitted.  \n2.6 Specific High Level Requirements \nSome high level requirements are required of the ELSS.  These requirements are listed below; \n\u2022 ELSS must retain all logbook reports and any corrections on the system at least until the end of each trip, i.e. on submission  of the electronic landing declaration or of a transhipment report. \n\u2022 Any ELSS software updates must not impact upon the ELSS\u2019s ability to meet the requirements set out in this document  and other test documentation . If it does then the product must be submitted for re-approval, and can not be deployed by fishing vessels until this is granted and the new version id is published on the UKFA web site lists \n\u2022 ELSS security and access controls such that  \no one usernamepassword must be provided for the owner of each vessel \no the owner is then able to set up subsidiary users such as the master of the vessel with their own username and password.   \no the username is required to be recorded in each report completed and in each transmission made; the person who has entered the data is required to \u201csign\u201d the Electronic Logbook data stating that they are aware of the responsibilitiesliabilities they are committing to in completing and / or transmitting  a report. \no Each copy of the ELSS installed must be provided with a unique internal?) number that is automatically entered into each transmission to identify the instance of the ELSS from which the report has been transmitted.  \n\u2022 ELSS must only be supplied for use at sea and loaded onto an onboard system and is not to be provided for onshore use by agents or representatives. Onshore entry is to be made through the ERS website or by use of the offline submission methods to be promulgated by the UK fisheries administrations, e.g. an emailed spreadsheet CSV formatted file.  To this end the UK   administrations will provide the Owner with the means for his agents) to logon to the ERS website to view the vessel trip record to date and the logbook numbers used, to aid their completion of the reports they wish to submit from their offices.

  "2009 - model manager": "3. System Features\nThis chapter describes the use cases for the MM in more detail. \nThe MM will manage jobs on one or more clusters. Node allocation, management and utilization will be provided by the MM SRS note: The MM provides centralized control over a collection of clusters.). For a user, this has the following implications: A user may not want or need to know how many and which clusters a MM is managing. She will submit a job to the MM and the MM will make the decision on what clusters) the job will be running. On the other hand, a user might need to submit customized jobs to a specific cluster. In this case, the user will need to have the option to specify what cluster hisher job should run on. Managing more than one cluster, will also allow RTFDDA and climoFDDA ensembles to run across several clusters. \nOnce a user is logged in into the system, she will be presented with the features in 2.2: \n\u2022 Submit a new job\n\u2022 Retrieve saved job configurations\n\u2022 View the job queuemonitor running jobs\nA new job can be submitted to the MM four different ways: \n\u2022 The user can set up a new model or &apos;post-processing&apos; job through the Job-Setup module and submit it 3.1 and 3.2).\n\u2022 The user can submit a &apos;by-hand&apos; job 3.3). \n\u2022 The user can submit a job by supplying a job configuration file to the MM 3.4). \n\u2022 The user can retrieve a job configuration that was previously saved with the MM, change it and re-submit that job 3. 5). If the user chooses to submit a new job, she will be given the following options to choose from:  \n\u2022 \u201cSetup a new model job\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cSetup a new &apos;post-processing&apos; job\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cSubmit a &apos;by-hand&apos; job\u201d\n\u2022 \u201dSubmit a job configuration file\u201d. \nNote that the above terminology is subject to change.\n3.1 Set up and submit a model job\nThis feature allows the user to set up and schedule a model job using the MM&apos;s Job-Setup module. Suppose the user is logged on to the system and has made the following choices \u201cSubmit a newjob\u201d -&gt; \u201cSet up a new model job\u201d. She is then presented with two more options: \u201c Weather FDDA\u201dand \u201cClimo\u201d. \nUse Case \u201cWeatherFDDA\u201d:  Setting up a  real time or off-line FDDA job     \n  The objective of this feature is to automate the set up of new real time and off-line FDDA jobs. This use case describes the set up of GMOD jobs, re-runs and case studies. At this point, RTFDDA ensemble jobs will be submitted to the MM as &apos;by hand&apos; jobs or through a job configuration file.\n       The MM will provide a default GMOD job configuration, which can be changed by the user TBDDefine the defaults for a GMOD job). It is important to note that the model manager will accept and run \u201ccustom\u201d GMOD jobs. These are jobs that are also set up through the Setup-module, but donot use the default GMOD configuration  For a \u201ccustom\u201d GMOD job, e.g., the user may choose to supply hisher own input data, own pre-processors or a customized version of a MM5 executable.\n\nMM&apos;s Job-Setup module will allow the user to substitute the default configuration, but it is the user&apos;s responsibility to make sure that these scripts, executables, etc.  reside on the cluster or clusters where the job will be running on. Submitting a \u201ccustom\u201d GMOD job thought the Job-Setup module will allow the user to save the job&apos;s configuration with the MM.\n     Primary actor: Meteorologist, software engineer\n     Goal: Set up and run a real time and off-line GMOD job   \n     Action Sequence: 1. User chooses to \u201cSet up  a Weather FDDA Job\u201d.\n2. User may choose a cluster where the job should run on. \n3. User decides what model should be used: MM5 or WRF.\n4. User defines a JOB ID.\n5. User determines domains TBD):\n\u2022 creates own domains Note: This may only apply to MM5 jobs. From earlier discussions: creating domain files for WRF takes a long time.) or\n\u2022 chooses between a number of pre-defined domains or\n\u2022 submits own TERRAIN files\n6. User defines when a job is to be run andor what cycle to run. If the cycle time is in the past, then the user is prompted to specify whether the job is a  \u201ccase study\u201d or \u201cre-run\u201d.\n7. User supplies other job specific information, such as, cycle interval, forecast length and other applicable information.\n8. User can specify whether to write restart files and the frequency of how often they are to be written TBD: Is this a correct statement and does frequency only apply to WRF?).\n9. User can choose between predefined sigma-level configurations or supply own sigma-level configuration\n10.User has the option to specify the number of nodes to use. \n11.User can choose to receive email notification upon start, end and termination of the job.\n12.User chooses between standard or custom ICBC data sources:\n\u2022 standard: ETA, AVNFTP GFS), GFS004 or\n\u2022 custom: provide data source e.g., hostFull_Path_to_Dir) or\n\u2022 For off-line jobs, the user must specify the data source, i.e., location MetVault or a directory) and time period. Important note for re-runs, if the input data is to obtain from the MetVault, then MetVault returns the data that was available and used in that cycle.\n\u2022 TBD: Determine standard ICBC data source and standard pre-processors.\n\n11.Depending on the choice above, user can provide custom IC/BC pre-processor or choose the standard:\n\u2022 standard processing or\n\u2022 provide own pre-processing script\n\n12.User is given the option to run additional pre-processors for the ICBC data, such as, LDAS or supply own custom pre-processor or skip this option.\n13.User chooses between standard andor custom obs data sources and processing:\n\u2022 Standard: WMO, SAMS, MADIS, GTS, RAWS, okmeso, SatWinds, ACARS, etc.andor\n\u2022 provide custom obs source1 and custom obs processor1\n\u2022 provide custom obs source2 and custom obs processor2\n\u2022 etc.or\n\u2022 For off-line jobs, the user must specify the data source, i.e., location MetVault or a directory) and time period. Important note for re-runs, if the input data is to obtain from the MetVault, then MetVault returns the data that was available andused in that cycle.\n\u2022 TBD: Define all standard observational data sources and identify their processing scripts.\n14.Depending on the choice of the model different options are given to the user:\n\u2022 MM5: The domain size and number of nodes for this job was determined earlier.\nBased on both choices, the user is presented with different MM5-executables to choose from. These executables have been compiled in advanced. The MM will be able to retrieve the compile info about the executables, e.g., domain size,number of nodes, number of sigma levels, etc. These few executables are standard executables TBD: determine what &apos;standard MM5 executable\u2019 means).Or, the user can also supply own executable, e.g., its location on the cluster\n\u2022 WRF: User defines model options TBD: determine possible model options)\n15.User chooses whether or not to run Final Analysis. This may only apply to re-runs andcase studies.\n16.User chooses whether or not to run Prelim. Analysis. This may only apply to re-runs and case studies.\n17.User chooses whether or not run additional processing on the model output. TBDWhat exactly are the options for additional processing? Bias Correction?) \n18.User can choose to save the model output in MetVault. If &apos;yes&apos;, user must specify what output file is to be sent to the MetVault. \n19.User is given the option to save and submit the job now. Submitting now, would run ICBC-data and obs processing and the model, no post-processing.  \n20.User chooses whether or not to run post-processing. If \u2018yes&apos;, then she will go through the action sequence in 3.4. TBD: How customizable should post-processing be? InGCAT, e.g., the user can specify locations for pseudo-soundings, cross sections,pseudo-obs, etc. Do MM -users at RAL need that level of post-processing customization? Do MM-users at the ranges need that level of post-processing customization, or would be a set pre-configured post-processing options be sufficient?)\n21.User can save the above job configuration. Job configurations can be saved to a file.\n22.User submits the job.\n    Use Case \u201cClimoFDDA\u201d:  Setting up a  ClimoFDDA job  \nThe objective of this feature is to integrate the GCAT functionalities within the MM.

User can save this job&apos;s setting. Job configurations can be saved to a file.\n\n8. User submits job. \n3.3 Submit a &apos;By-hand&apos; job\nThe objective of this feature is to accommodate the current GMOD-framework. It will also give the user the ability to run customized jobs. In order to submit a custom job to the MM, the user must first identify the clusters), where hisher job should run on. Then, log on to this machine, perform operations that are necessary for setting up the job and then register the job with the MM see Action Sequence below). It is important to note that since a &apos;by-hand&apos; job wasn&apos;t set up through MM&apos;s Job-Setup module, the MM doesn&apos;t know what the job is actually doing. In order for the MM to accept the job, the user will have to provide certain mandatory information about the job. Suppose the user is logged on to the system and has made the following choice, \u201cSubmit a new job\u201d.\n     Primary actor: Meteorologist, software engineer\n     Goal: Register a custom model job with the MM  \n      Action Sequence: 1.
